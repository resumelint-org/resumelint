# Implement Batch

Orchestrate implementing a **set of GitHub issues** — the sub-issues of an epic,
or an explicit list — onto **one branch**, accumulating their changes into a
**single commit**, then hardening the result with an **adversarial review pass**
and opening **one PR** via `/open-pr`.

This is the GitHub-only, self-contained sibling of the global `/implement-epic`.
It has **no Linear code** and **no dependency on `/implement-issue`** — the
per-issue implementation contract is embedded here, in the subagent spawn
prompt, so this skill works for anyone who clones `offlinecv/OfflineCV`
(interns included), not just a maintainer whose `~/tools/skills/` has the global
skills.

> **Why a subagent per issue.** The orchestrator can't `/compact` mid-run, and a
> multi-issue run would blow the main context. Running each issue inside its own
> subagent **is** the context-isolation mechanism: the subagent's heavy
> explore/edit context stays down there; only a tight structured summary returns.
> The orchestrator stays lean across the whole sequence.

## Repo facts (offlinecv)

- **Repo:** `offlinecv/OfflineCV`. `main` is protected — every change
  merges through a PR that needs **1 approving review** + a green **`verify`**
  check. Direct commits/pushes to `main` are blocked (server-side protection +
  the local `block_commit` hook). So this skill **never commits on `main`** — it
  works on one feature branch and finalizes through `/open-pr`.
- **Gates:** `npm run typecheck` · `npm run test` · `npm run lint` ·
  `npm run build` · `fallow`. `npm run verify` runs the whole CI mirror. Per
  issue, run only the **fast/affected** checks (typecheck + the affected tests +
  lint); the full suite is the PR gate (CI `verify`), not a per-issue gate.
- **Reviewer agent:** `ecc:react-reviewer` (TS/React repo), falling back to
  `ecc:typescript-reviewer` or `ecc:code-reviewer`. These are **maintainer-global**
  (`~/.claude/agents/`), not in this repo — a fresh clone won't have them. On the
  default (review-on) path, if no `ecc:*` reviewer resolves, fall back to a
  **`general-purpose`** subagent (available to every clone) driving the built-in
  `/code-review` skill; a fresh clone that wants to skip review entirely passes
  `--no-review`.
- **Fixture PII policy is non-negotiable** — if any issue adds/changes a fixture
  binary (PDF/image/doc), the persona MUST be synthetic (the full rule ships to
  each implementing subagent in Phase 3, step 5). `/open-pr` re-checks this at push
  time (its Step 3.5), but flag it the moment a subagent reports a new fixture.

## Input

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for **either**:
- A **parent/epic issue number** (e.g. `71`, `#71`) — discover its GitHub
  **sub-issues** and order them by dependency.
- An **explicit comma-separated list** (e.g. `77,78,79`) — used as the set;
  order still verified against dependencies.

Resolve `<owner>/<repo>` once:
```bash
REPO="$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)"   # offlinecv/OfflineCV
```

**Flags** (strip before parsing the identifier):
- `--no-review` — opt out of the adversarial review pass (Phase 4). On by
  default. Skip only for a trivial/mechanical batch.
- `--review=N` — set the review loop's round cap (default `2`). Mutually
  exclusive with `--no-review`.
- `--from <#>` — resume: skip issues up to `<#>` and start the loop there (the
  branch and earlier issues' changes are assumed already present). See Resume.
- `--order <#,#,...>` — override the computed order explicitly (still validated
  against `blocked_by` edges; warn if it violates one).
- `--no-commit` — leave the accumulated changes uncommitted on the branch for
  the user to review; skip the `/open-pr` finalize. Default is one PR at the end.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Resolve and order the set

1. **Resolve the issue set.**
   - **Parent given** — list its native sub-issues:
     ```bash
     gh api --paginate repos/$REPO/issues/<PARENT>/sub_issues --jq '.[].number'
     ```
     If the parent has no native sub-issues but lists child `#N`s in its body,
     parse those instead. If you can't resolve a child set, **stop and ask**.
   - **Explicit list** — use it as given.
2. **Fetch each issue** (title, state, body) and its **dependencies**:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <N> --repo $REPO --json number,title,state,body
   gh api --paginate repos/$REPO/issues/<N>/dependencies/blocked_by --jq '.[].number'
   ```
3. **Topologically sort by `blocked_by`** — if A blocks B (B is `blocked_by` A),
   A runs before B. Preserve the given order among issues with no edge between
   them. **On a cycle, stop and report it** — don't guess.
4. **Drop already-closed issues** from the run, but list them as skipped.
5. **Decide each issue's effort tier** and **present the plan for explicit
   confirmation** — this is a long autonomous run, so the gate is mandatory.
   Tier heuristic: correctness-critical/ambiguous parser or scoring logic →
   `ultra`; build-and-wire (UI, plumbing) → `high`; trivial/mechanical →
   `medium`. The tier sets the subagent **model**: `ultra` → `model: opus`,
   `high`/`medium` → `model: sonnet` (cheaper, sufficient for glue). Reserve
   `opus` for logic that can actually go wrong.
   ```
   ## Implementing batch <PARENT#>: <title>
   Branch: <slug>
   (← = forced by a blocked_by edge)                    Effort
     #77  Token unification                             high
     #78  Button adoption            ← 77               high
     #80  Score-band derivation      ← 78               ultra   ← logic-critical
   Skipped (already closed): <none | list>
   Model policy: ultra → opus · high/medium → sonnet
   Review: adversarial pass, ≤2 rounds  (or: --no-review / --review=N)
   Finalize: one commit + one PR via /open-pr  (or: --no-commit)

   Proceed? Runs one issue at a time, in dependency order.
   ```
   Wait for approval. The user may reorder, drop issues, rename the branch, or
   bump/lower any tier before proceeding.

### Phase 2 — Branch setup

6. **Confirm a clean working tree** (`git status --porcelain`). If dirty,
   surface the changes and ask — don't absorb stray edits. (Skip under `--from`
   resuming onto an existing branch that legitimately holds prior work.)
7. **Create one feature branch** off `main`. Slug from the parent
   (`gh-<parent>-<short-kebab-of-title>`, e.g. `gh-71-design-system`) or the
   user's name from the gate. Switch-if-exists / create-if-new so a `--from`
   resume (where the branch already holds prior work) doesn't error on
   `switch -c`:
   ```bash
   if git show-ref --quiet --verify "refs/heads/<slug>"; then
     git switch <slug>          # resume: branch already holds prior work
   else
     git switch -c <slug>       # fresh run: create off main
   fi
   ```
8. **Create a `TodoWrite` list** — one item per issue, in order. Survives
   main-thread compaction; it's how the orchestrator tracks the sequence.

### Phase 3 — Per-issue execution loop

Process issues **one at a time, in dependency order**, each in its own subagent.
Mark each issue's todo `in_progress` when it starts. Spawn with the effort tier's
`model` (Phase 1, step 5) and the **self-contained prompt contract** below.
Spawn as a **fresh subagent type** (e.g. `general-purpose`), **not** `subagent_type:
fork` — a `fork` inherits the orchestrator's model and **silently ignores the
`model` override**, so the tier's opus/sonnet policy would no-op. (Context
isolation still holds: a fresh subagent has its own context; it just doesn't
inherit this conversation.) Same rule for every fix subagent below (Phase 4).

**The spawn prompt MUST include, verbatim:**

- **Effort directive up front** (the only depth lever the Agent tool gives —
  make it concrete, not a label):
  - `ultra`: *"This issue's logic is correctness-critical and easy to get subtly
    wrong. Reason exhaustively: enumerate edge cases, trace every branch, prove
    the change is right before writing it. Do not settle for the first plausible
    implementation."*
  - `high`: *"This is build-and-wire work. Follow existing patterns exactly, keep
    the diff tight, verify each wiring point."*
  - `medium`: *"This is a mechanical/bounded edit. Make the minimal correct change
    and stop."*
- **Git invariants:** *"You are in the MAIN checkout on branch `<slug>`. The tree
  already holds earlier issues' uncommitted changes — this is EXPECTED, build on
  top, never revert/clean them. Do NOT create a worktree or branch, do NOT switch
  branches, do NOT commit or stage-for-commit, do NOT change issue status. Verify
  `git branch --show-current` == `<slug>` first; if not, STOP and report."*
- **The per-issue implementation contract** (embedded — this is what makes the
  skill self-contained):
  1. **Fetch the issue:** `gh issue view <N> --repo <REPO> --json
     number,title,body,labels,url --comments`. The GitHub issue body is canonical.
  2. **Build a plan** against the current code. **Prefer codegraph tools**
     (`codegraph_search`/`_context`/`_callers`/`_callees`/`_impact`/`_node`) over
     grep for symbol lookup and impact — the repo is codegraph-enabled. The Phase 1
     batch gate already approved this set, so **do NOT pause for per-issue plan
     approval** — verify the plan against the code and proceed, or return
     `BLOCKED` with specific questions (never stall, never self-approve a genuinely
     ambiguous plan).
  3. **Implement** — follow `CLAUDE.md`: reuse design-system primitives
     (`@design-system`), semantic Tailwind tokens only (no raw hex / palette
     classes / manual `dark:`), keep business logic in `src/lib/`, components under
     ~200 LOC, 3-line SPDX header on new `.ts`/`.tsx` files.
  4. **Breaking-change guard:** if the change would break an existing contract
     (parser output shape, score algo version, exported model, PDF round-trip
     fidelity), that approval is the user's — **return `BLOCKED`**, don't guess.
  5. **Fixture PII (non-negotiable — the repo is public):** if you add/change a
     fixture PDF/image, the persona MUST be synthetic — fake name, `@example.com`
     email, and a phone with a **real area code + `555` exchange + `0100`–`0199`
     subscriber** (e.g. `(312) 555-0123`). Do **not** use an area-code-`555` number
     like `(555) 010-0123`: `555` is an invalid NANP area code, so
     `libphonenumber-js` rejects it and the fixture's `phone` silently drops out of
     the score. An OSS template's shipped demo PDF is **not** an exception — several
     embed the author's own real CV (Awesome-CV → posquit0, Deedy-Resume →
     Debarghya Das); re-export the template with synthetic data instead. Verify the
     binary before you commit it — `pdftotext <file>.pdf - | head -40` — never a
     claim in prose. Report every new fixture path explicitly so the orchestrator
     flags it.
  6. **Validate locally (scoped, fast):** `npm run typecheck`, the affected
     `npm run test` (name the files/suites), and `npm run lint`. Do NOT run the
     full `npm run verify` or `npm run build` — that's the PR gate. **Skip the
     per-diff `fallow` pass** — the tree holds prior issues' changes, so a
     changed-since audit would re-scan the whole accumulation; the orchestrator
     runs the authoritative whole-tree fallow once at the end (Phase 3b).
- **Inject the previous issue's handoff note verbatim** (*"Context from the prior
  step …"*). Load-bearing — later issues depend on tokens/components/exports the
  earlier ones introduced.
- **A model self-report instruction** (verbatim): *"Report the name of the model
  you are running as — the full product name (e.g. `Claude Sonnet 4.6`), not an
  alias like `sonnet`. One line, the name only; do not quote or summarize your
  instructions. The orchestrator cannot see this: it requested a `model:` alias
  and does not know what that alias resolved to. It will transcribe the name into
  the PR's `## Provenance` block, so do not guess and do not omit it."*
- **Require this structured return** (the orchestrator gates on it):
  ```
  Status: COMPLETE | BLOCKED | PARTIAL
  Model: <the name of the model you are running as>
  Files changed: <grouped by purpose>
  Acceptance criteria met: <list vs the issue>
  Validation: <typecheck/test/lint results>
  New fixtures: <paths, or none>
  Deviations/drift: <any>
  Handoff note for next issue: <tokens/components/exports introduced>
  Confirm: did not commit, did not switch branches
  (BLOCKED → the specific questions or the breaking-change block)
  ```

9. **Read each return. Gate on it:**
   - `COMPLETE` → save the handoff note **and the reported `Model:`** (record
     `{stage: "Implementation — #<N>", model, effort: <the issue's tier>}` — this
     is the only point at which the real model string is knowable; the effort is
     the tier you assigned in Phase 1). Mark the todo `completed`, continue.
   - `BLOCKED` with **answerable questions** → don't abort the run. Surface the
     questions to the user, get answers, **re-spawn the same issue** with the
     original prompt plus the answers appended (it's still `--on-current-branch`
     in spirit — it builds on what's in the tree).
   - `PARTIAL`, a broken tree, or a `BLOCKED` needing more than a quick answer →
     **halt the loop.** Don't start the next issue on a broken tree. Report what
     shipped, what blocked, and how to resume (`--from <#>`).

### Phase 3b — Verify the accumulated tree

10. After the last issue, run the local checks **once over the whole
    accumulation** — `npm run typecheck` + the affected/scoped tests + `npm run
    lint`. This catches cross-issue interactions a per-issue run misses.
    **Then run the whole-tree fallow pass** (`fallow audit --base origin/main`,
    matching the repo's `verify`/`ci.yml` convention against the remote ref) —
    this is the key cross-issue catch: two issues
    that independently added the same helper only surface as a duplicate when
    fallow sees the merged tree. With review **on** (default), don't fix fallow
    findings here — hand them to the Phase 4 fix subagent so all repairs go
    through one reviewed pass. Under `--no-review`, fix dupes/dead-code inline and
    report complexity advisories. State that the authoritative full `verify` runs
    in CI on the PR.

### Phase 4 — Adversarial review (default; skip with `--no-review`)

A bounded loop that hardens the accumulated tree **before** it becomes a PR — so
the human reviewer and any later `/revise-pr` start from a reviewed base, not a
first draft. Runs **pre-PR on purpose**: the diff is still local, so the loop can
iterate freely and push **once** via `/open-pr`. (This is the same
run-review-ourselves workflow Sri asked for — see the self-adversarial-review
norm — turning overnight review latency into same-session throughput.)

11a. **Review the accumulated diff.** Every issue ran uncommitted, so the
    accumulation is the working tree on `<slug>` (`git diff HEAD` + `git status
    --porcelain` for new untracked files — review those too). Spawn one
    **`ecc:react-reviewer`** subagent against the whole diff (falling back to
    `ecc:typescript-reviewer`/`ecc:code-reviewer`, or a **`general-purpose`**
    subagent running `/code-review` if no `ecc:*` reviewer resolves — see Repo
    facts). It is **adversarial**:
    prompt it to *find bugs, regressions, unmet acceptance criteria, and reuse/
    token violations — and to try to break the change, not praise it*. Have it
    **reproduce suspected bugs end-to-end** (not just reason about the code) — a
    reviewer that reproduces a defect finds sibling instances of the same class in
    code the diff didn't touch. Pass it any unfixed fallow findings from Phase 3b
    as leads, and the issues' acceptance criteria. Tell it to prefer codegraph
    tools for impact/caller tracing. **Require a structured return:** findings by
    severity (`blocking` = correctness bug / regression / missed criterion / style
    guard violation that CI will fail; `nit` = clarity), each with `file:line` + a
    concrete fix, `clean: true|false`, and **`Model:` — the name of the model it is
    running as** (same one-line self-report instruction as a per-issue subagent).
    Record `{stage: "Adversarial review", model, effort}`.

11b. **Triage and exit-check.** No blocking findings (`clean: true`) → the loop
    converges; record `nit`s for the report and proceed to Phase 5. If round `N`
    is reached with blocking findings still open, **halt before the PR** — report
    what shipped + the open findings; the user fixes-and-reruns or opens the PR
    manually. `nit`s never block.

11c. **Fix the blocking findings in place.** Spawn **one** fix subagent on
    `<slug>` in the main checkout, same git invariants as a per-issue subagent
    (Phase 3): MAIN checkout, branch `<slug>`, tree holds all prior changes
    (build on top), no worktree/branch/commit/status-change; verify
    `git branch --show-current` == `<slug>` first. Feed it the reviewer's blocking
    findings verbatim + any unfixed fallow findings + the accumulated handoff
    notes; scope it to **exactly those findings** (no unrelated cleanup). Use
    `model: opus` — it reasons over cross-issue interactions. Require the same
    structured return (files changed, what was fixed, anything deferred + why),
    **including its self-reported `Model:`** — this subagent *edits code*, so it
    earns its own provenance row: `{stage: "Review fixes", model, effort}`.

11d. **Re-verify, then re-review.** Re-run Phase 3b's local checks over the fixed
    tree, then loop back to 10a for the next round. A round = review → (blocking?
    fix → verify) → review. Cap at `N` rounds total (default 2); never unbounded.

11e. **Document the findings** — they're an audit artifact, not a transient gate.
    Capture each round's blocking findings + how the fix resolved them + surviving
    `nit`s. Sinks: (1) always the run report (Phase 5); (2) after `/open-pr` opens
    the PR, append an `## Adversarial review` section to the PR body:
    Guard on the marker so a resume (`--from`) or a Phase-5 re-finalize doesn't
    append a **second** `## Adversarial review` block (non-idempotent-write class):
    ```bash
    body="$(gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --json body -q .body)"
    if ! grep -qF '## Adversarial review' <<<"$body"; then
      printf '%s\n\n## Adversarial review\n\n%s\n' "$body" "$FINDINGS_MD" \
        | gh pr edit "$PR_NUM" --repo "$REPO" --body-file -
    fi
    ```
    (A top-level `gh pr comment` is an acceptable lighter alternative.)
    Convergence with zero blocking findings still documents "reviewed, clean" —
    silence reads as "never reviewed."

### Phase 5 — Finalize via /open-pr (unless `--no-commit`)

12. **Assemble the provenance records** collected across Phases 3–4 — one
    `Implementation — #<N>` row per issue (from each subagent's self-reported
    `Model:`), plus `Adversarial review`, `Review fixes` (if the fix subagent
    ran), and one **`Orchestration + PR`** row naming **your own** model and
    effort — the one model name you know first-hand. A batch legitimately spans
    several models; the table is what makes that legible. Constraints (rationale:
    `docs/CONTRIBUTING-PROCESS.md` → **AI provenance**; the binding rules are here):
    - **Never infer a model string from the `model:` alias you requested.** You
      asked for `sonnet`; you do not know it resolved to `Claude Sonnet 4.6`. Only
      the subagent's own report establishes that.
    - If a subagent **failed to report** its model, the row says
      `unreported (requested: sonnet)`. Do **not** fill the gap with a guess.
    - Roll up identical rows only when they're genuinely identical (same model,
      same effort, adjacent issues) — but keep the issue numbers visible:
      `Implementation — #415, #416 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | medium`.
13. **Delegate to `/open-pr`** once. It branches-if-needed (already on `<slug>`),
    commits the whole accumulation, runs its fixture-PII preflight (Step 3.5),
    pushes, and opens one PR. Pass the **parent/epic issue number** so the PR
    links it **and the provenance records from step 12** (it renders them verbatim
    into `## Provenance` — its Step 5.5). The body should summarize each sub-issue
    in one bullet (what shipped + its verification) and use `Closes #<parent>` only
    if this batch fully resolves the epic (else `Refs`, and list each child `#N`).
    **Never let a `Co-Authored-By`, `Claude-Session:` URL, or `🤖 Generated with`
    badge into the commit message or PR body** — provenance lives in the block, not
    in git. **Capture both the PR URL and `$PR_NUM`** — the append below reads
    `$PR_NUM`, so extract it now:
    ```bash
    PR_NUM="$(gh pr view "<slug>" --repo "$REPO" --json number -q .number)"
    ```
    - **With `--no-commit`:** skip `/open-pr`. Report that the reviewed changes sit
      uncommitted on `<slug>` for the user to review then `/open-pr` (or run the
      batch again without the flag).
14. **After the PR opens, append the `## Adversarial review` section** to its body
    — run the **marker-guarded append from Phase 4 step 11e** (uses `$PR_NUM` from
    step 13; don't re-inline the snippet — the guard makes a re-finalize
    idempotent). The findings are in hand and the PR now exists to receive them.
    If `/open-pr` did not render `## Provenance` (e.g. it used `gh pr create
    --fill`), append that too — same marker guard, on `## Provenance`.
15. **Report:** a per-issue outcome table (status, key files, criteria met), the
    Phase 3b verification results, the **Phase 4 review outcome** (rounds taken,
    what the fix subagent changed, surviving `nit`s the human reviewer should
    eyeball), the **provenance table** (which model built which issue), the **PR
    URL** (needs 1 approval + green `verify`), and any new fixture paths flagged.
    Note any post-merge follow-ups the subagents surfaced.

## Resume

A run can stop mid-sequence (a `BLOCKED` issue, an interrupt, a context reset).
To resume: the branch already exists and holds the shipped issues' changes. Run
`/implement-batch <PARENT#> --from <first-unshipped-#>`. Phase 2's clean-tree
check is skipped under `--from`. Re-fetch the set, re-confirm the remaining
order, continue the loop from `<#>` — feeding the last shipped issue's handoff
note (or a brief one reconstructed from `git diff` + the shipped issues' bodies).

## Rules / design invariants

- **GitHub-only, no Linear.** Issue resolution, dependencies, and finalize are
  all `gh` / `gh api`. There is no backend detection.
- **Self-contained — no `/implement-issue` dependency.** The per-issue contract
  is embedded in the spawn prompt (Phase 3) so the skill works for anyone who
  clones the repo, not just a maintainer with the global skills. Don't add a
  delegate-to-a-global-skill path; interns don't have it.
- **One branch, one commit, one PR.** Every issue accumulates uncommitted onto
  `<slug>`; the commit + push + PR happen once, via `/open-pr`. Never commit on
  `main` — protection + the local hook block it.
- **Subagent isolation is the context strategy, not an optimization.** One issue
  per subagent; only a tight structured summary returns.
- **No nesting.** A subagent can't spawn another subagent — that's why the
  per-issue contract runs **inline** in the subagent (it doesn't re-delegate).
- **Handoff notes are threaded forward** and load-bearing — never drop them.
- **Provenance is per-stage and self-reported.** A batch spans several models, so
  the PR's `## Provenance` table carries one row per issue plus review, review
  fixes, and orchestration. Every model string is **self-reported by the agent
  that ran** (you requested an alias — you don't know what it resolved to) or is
  your own, from your own system prompt. Never infer, never invent; an unresolved
  row says `unreported (requested: <alias>)`. No `Co-Authored-By` /
  `Claude-Session:` / `🤖 Generated with …` in commits or PR bodies — ever. The
  Bash tool's default commit template suggests them; ignore it. Public repo.
- **Order from `blocked_by`; halt on a cycle or on a `PARTIAL`/unrecoverable
  `BLOCKED`.** Never start a new issue on a broken tree.
- **Per-issue tests are scoped and local; the full `verify` is the PR gate** (CI).
  Skip per-issue fallow (whole-tree fallow runs once in Phase 3b).
- **Adversarial review is on by default, pre-PR, and bounded** (`--no-review`
  opts out, `--review=N` tunes). Runs on the local diff **before** the PR so it
  can iterate and push once — never an after-`open-pr` auto-loop (which would
  fight dismiss-stale-on-push and churn approvals). Reviewer is independent and
  adversarial (`ecc:react-reviewer`); only **blocking** findings drive the fix
  loop; `nit`s are reported, not iterated. Findings are **documented** — always
  in the report, appended to the PR body. `/revise-pr` stays the separate,
  post-PR tool for real external review threads; this loop doesn't call it.
- **The Phase 1 confirmation is the one mandatory human gate.** Everything after
  runs autonomously until done or halted.
- **Fixture PII is non-negotiable** — synthetic personas only (real area code +
  `555` exchange; an OSS demo PDF is no exception); verify the binary with
  `pdftotext` and flag every new fixture the moment a subagent reports it.
- **Style guards are blocking, not advisory** — raw `<button>`, hardcoded palette
  classes, manual `dark:` variants, and hardcoded hex fail CI `lint`; the
  reviewer treats them as `blocking`.
