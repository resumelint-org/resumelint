description: Place a GitHub issue onto the offlinecv roadmap — assign it to the right milestone, add it to the "ResumeLint v1" project board, and set its Phase. Use when the user says "triage this issue", "/triage-issue", "add this to the roadmap/board", or files/finds an issue with no milestone.

# Triage Issue

Take an issue from "filed, but floating" to "on the roadmap": pick the right
**milestone**, add it to the **project board**, and set its **Phase** so it lands
in the right column. This is the recurring action every contributor does on a new
issue — keep it light and consistent.

The roadmap shape (milestones + the board's Phase options) is **read live** from
GitHub, never hardcoded here, so this skill keeps working as the roadmap evolves.

## Input

Parse the argument for an **issue number** (`29`, `#29`) and optionally a target
milestone/phase hint. If no issue number is given, list open issues with **no
milestone** and ask which to triage:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,milestone \
  --jq '.[] | select(.milestone == null) | "#\(.number)\t\(.title)"'
```

## Process

### Step 0: Detect repo + read the live roadmap

```bash
REPO="$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)"   # offlinecv/OfflineCV
OWNER="${REPO%%/*}"                                             # offlinecv

# Open milestones (the canonical roadmap buckets)
gh api "repos/$REPO/milestones?state=open" \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.number)\t\(.title)\t\(.description // "")"'
```

Read the milestone **titles + descriptions** — the description says what role each
milestone plays (e.g. which one gates launch, which is the minimum bar). Use that
to choose, don't guess from the title alone.

### Step 1: Read the issue and pick a milestone

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,labels,milestone
```

Match the issue to a milestone by **what it delivers**, using the milestone
descriptions from Step 0. The roadmap is an **audience-gated** scheme (`P1`…`P4`) —
each milestone is "who can use it next," not a subsystem. Read the live
descriptions from Step 0; the current buckets are:

- **`P1 · Friends & Family`** — core loop trustworthy on normal resumes (drop →
  correct parse + score → safe download). Parser/score/edit correctness that keeps a
  well-formatted single-column resume from visibly breaking lands here.
- **`P2 · Design Partner`** — differentiators (semantic JD-match, AI rewrite),
  reliability across diverse/edge PDFs (two-column, round-trip), and score
  transparency, for partners who commit structured feedback.
- **`P3 · Public Launch`** — polish, standards compliance, positioning (JSON Resume
  export, profiles model, JD-match v2 eval/telemetry/docs close-out).
- **`P4 · Post-Public`** — work deliberately deferred past launch (job-search lane,
  local-first storage, resume library, job tracker, blank-resume authoring,
  code-health cleanup).

These titles change — **always match against the live Step 0 list, never this
snapshot.** If the fit is genuinely ambiguous, ask the user rather than guessing.

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --milestone "<exact milestone title>"
```

### Step 2: Find the project board

```bash
PROJ_NUM="$(gh project list --owner "$OWNER" --format json \
  --jq '.projects[] | select(.title=="ResumeLint v1") | .number')"
PROJ_ID="$(gh project list --owner "$OWNER" --format json \
  --jq '.projects[] | select(.title=="ResumeLint v1") | .id')"
```

If `PROJ_NUM` is empty, the board doesn't exist yet — see **First-time setup**
below, or just stop after the milestone assignment and tell the user the board is
missing.

### Step 3: Add the issue to the board

```bash
ITEM_ID="$(gh project item-add "$PROJ_NUM" --owner "$OWNER" \
  --url "https://github.com/$REPO/issues/<N>" \
  --format json --jq .id)"
```

`item-add` is idempotent-ish: re-adding an existing item returns its id, so this
is safe to re-run.

### Step 4: Set the Phase field to match the milestone (only if an option corresponds)

Read the `Phase` field id and its option ids live:

```bash
gh project field-list "$PROJ_NUM" --owner "$OWNER" --format json \
  --jq '.fields[] | select(.name=="Phase") | {fieldId:.id, opts:[.options[]|{name,id}]}'
```

**The Phase options and the milestones can drift out of sync** — the board's `Phase`
field currently carries an older subsystem scheme (`M1 Parser Hardening`, `M2 UI
Parity`, …) while milestones are the audience-gated `P1`…`P4`. Set Phase **only when
a listed option clearly corresponds** to the chosen milestone. If none does, **leave
Phase blank** — that is the current convention (existing `P3`/`P4` items sit on the
board with an empty Phase), and the milestone is the load-bearing signal regardless.
Do **not** force a wrong Phase to fill the column, and do **not** invent a Phase
option here (option edits are a maintainer decision — see First-time setup).

When an option does correspond, set it (match on the meaningful part, not
punctuation):

```bash
gh project item-edit --project-id "$PROJ_ID" --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id "<Phase field id>" --single-select-option-id "<matching option id>"
```

> **Maintainer note:** if the Phase options should track the `P1`…`P4` milestones,
> realign them once in the web UI (or via `gh project field-*`) so future triage can
> set a Phase instead of leaving it blank. Until then, blank-when-no-match is correct.

### Step 5: Report

Print: the issue, the milestone it landed in, and that it's on the board in the
right Phase column. Link the board: `https://github.com/orgs/$OWNER/projects/$PROJ_NUM`.

## If you lack `project` scope

`gh project` commands need the `project` token scope (`gh auth refresh -s project`).
Without it, Steps 2–4 fail. That's fine — **the milestone assignment (Step 1) is
the load-bearing part** and only needs `repo` scope. Do Step 1, skip the board,
and tell the user to add the issue to the board in the web UI (or refresh scope).
Never block triage on the board.

## First-time setup (maintainers only)

Run **once** to stand up the roadmap. Skip entirely if milestones / the board
already exist.

Create milestones (one per delivery phase; the description carries the role):

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/milestones" -f title="<title>" -f description="<role in the release>"
```

Create the board + the Phase field, with one option per milestone:

```bash
gh project create --owner "$OWNER" --title "ResumeLint v1"
# Phase options should mirror the CURRENT milestone titles so triage can set a
# matching Phase (Step 4). Read them live first, don't paste a stale list:
#   gh api "repos/$REPO/milestones?state=open" --jq '[.[].title]|join(",")'
gh project field-create <PROJ_NUM> --owner "$OWNER" --name "Phase" \
  --data-type SINGLE_SELECT \
  --single-select-options "P1 Friends & Family,P2 Design Partner,P3 Public Launch,P4 Post-Public"
```

Then add a **Board** view in the web UI grouped by **Phase** (view layout/grouping
can't be set from `gh`). After that, per-issue triage is the only recurring task —
use the Process above.

## Rules

- **Read the roadmap live** (Step 0 / Step 4) — never hardcode milestone titles or
  Phase option ids. They change; the skill shouldn't.
- **Milestone first, board second.** Milestone assignment is the durable signal and
  needs only `repo` scope. The board is a view on top — degrade gracefully if the
  `project` scope or the board is missing.
- **One milestone per issue.** If an issue spans phases, it's two issues.
- **Don't invent milestones during triage.** Creating milestones is a maintainer
  decision (First-time setup) — if nothing fits, ask, don't auto-create.
- Pure `gh` CLI — no external services, no machine-specific paths. Works for any
  contributor with `gh` installed and authed.
