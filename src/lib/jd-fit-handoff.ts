/**
 * One-shot resume handoff from `/` (parser audit) to `/jd-fit` (issue #226).
 *
 * When a user parses a résumé on `/` and clicks "Check fit against a job", the
 * parse is stashed here so `/jd-fit` can rehydrate it without re-parsing the
 * PDF. We hand off the PARSED JSON, not the PDF bytes — JD-fit doesn't show the
 * source-PDF pane, and JSON survives the navigation cheaply.
 *
 * What crosses is the PRISTINE parse + score and the user's EDIT STATE as a
 * separate `edit` snapshot (#456) — never the override-APPLIED result. `/jd-fit`
 * runs its own edit layer, so it must receive the same two inputs `/` had and
 * re-apply them itself. Handing over an applied result instead made the edits
 * unrecoverable on the far side: they had already been baked into the fields, so
 * `/jd-fit` could not tell a user-ADDED entry from a parsed one (it lost its
 * Remove button) and its fresh, empty edit layer re-derived achievement fields
 * from the applied ones. Re-seeding the far side from an applied payload is NOT
 * a fix — the entries would be appended a second time.
 *
 * Stored under sessionStorage (not localStorage) because this is a
 * within-session, within-tab handoff — it must not leak a parsed résumé into a
 * later, unrelated session. Consumed once: `/jd-fit` reads then clears the key
 * on mount, so a manual reload falls back to its own DropZone.
 *
 * Key follows the repo's `rl_*` storage convention.

 * `.sectionHeadings` would revive as empty `{}` and the scorer's
 * `sections.byName.get(...)` would throw on `/jd-fit`. We tag Maps on write and
 * rebuild them on read. Structural (not path-based) so it survives further
 * canonical-shape churn (#441): any `Map` anywhere in the payload round-trips.
 *
 * `__rlMap` is a RESERVED key in this handoff payload (#452 review): `reviveMaps`
 * rebuilds any object with an array-valued `__rlMap` prop into a `Map`, so no
 * résumé field may carry a literal `__rlMap` array of its own — it would be
 * silently coerced to a `Map` on read. No canonical field has that shape today.
