/**
 * apply-accepted.ts — fold per-bullet accept/reject/edit decisions over an
 * alignment into a result the caller can write back (issue #211).
 *
 * Two pure outputs from the same fold:
 *   - {@link applyAcceptedBullets}    — the final ORDERED bullet list for a
 *     section, the textual "what the résumé would read after accepting these".
 *     This is the unit-tested contract (M≠N, additions, removals, edits).
 *   - {@link resolveBulletActions}    — the same decisions expressed as
 *     per-original-bullet WRITE actions (replace / remove / add) the UI layer
 *     maps onto the reconstructed-résumé edit primitives
 *     (`setBulletField` / `removeBullet` / `addBullet`). It carries no
 *     BulletObservation indices itself — the caller joins `originalIndex`
 *     (position within the section) to the real observation index.
 *
 * Decision semantics (per aligned pair id):
 *   - matched, accepted  → original is REPLACED by the edited value (if the
 *     user edited it) else the proposed text.
 *   - matched, rejected/undecided → original kept verbatim.
 *   - added,   accepted  → the edited-or-proposed text is INSERTED.
 *   - added,   rejected/undecided → nothing inserted.
 *   - removed, accepted  → the original is DROPPED.
 *   - removed, rejected/undecided → original kept verbatim.
 *
 * "undecided" (no entry in the decisions map) is treated exactly like
 * "rejected": Apply never changes a bullet the user didn't explicitly accept.
 * Edits without an accept are inert — an edit auto-accepts in the hook layer,
 * so by the time decisions reach here an edited pair is already accepted; but
 * even if it weren't, an un-accepted edit is ignored, never silently applied.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no mutation of the inputs.
