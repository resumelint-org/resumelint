/**
 * Summary-paragraph rewrite primitive used by the chain-of-sections
 * orchestrator (#67).
 *
 * The summary section is the first section in the chain. It is a 2–3
 * sentence paragraph rather than a bullet list, so the bullet-shaped
 * `rewriteSectionWithLlm` prompt does not fit — it would coerce the model
 * into emitting one bullet per line and we'd lose the paragraph shape.
 *
 * Mirrors the section primitive's contracts:
 *   - Takes the engine + model id so telemetry can be model-dimensioned and
 *     the cross-model `acquireInference` lock can defer `.unload()` while
 *     this call is in flight.
 *   - Runs the deterministic number-preservation check after the model
 *     responds (same `checkNumbersPreserved` used by the section path —
 *     the multiset diff is shape-agnostic).
 *   - Returns `numbersPreserved` + `dropped/added` so the UI can surface
 *     the same inline warning shape as the section path.
 *
 * Output handling: paragraphs sometimes come back across multiple lines if
 * the model adds a wrap (or hallucinates a `Rewritten:` echo). We run each
 * non-empty line through the shared `cleanRewriteLine` helper, then join
 * with a single space — that flattens any spurious wrap without losing
 * intra-paragraph punctuation.
 *
 * No first-rewrite telemetry: the orchestrator owns the resume-level
 * one-shot flag (`webllm_first_resume_rewrite`). The per-section /
 * per-bullet one-shots stay distinct so the funnels don't cross-pollute.
