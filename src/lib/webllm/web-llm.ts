 * only downloads it on first click. The constructed engine is cached for
 * the page lifetime so subsequent clicks (and concurrent clicks from
 * multiple bullet rows) all share one engine and one download.
 *
 * On failure (OOM, dropped network, etc.) the cache is reset to `null` so
 * the UI's "Try again" button can re-attempt. The original promise still
 * rejects to the caller — the `.catch` here only resets the slot.
 * `downloadStartedFired` deliberately stays `true` so a retry doesn't
 * double-fire `webllm_download_started` for the same logical attempt.
 *
 * Telemetry: fires `webllm_download_started` on the first call and
 * `webllm_loaded` once the engine is ready. Both fire at most once per page.
