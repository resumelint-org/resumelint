 * Lexical helpers for cross-section action-verb tracking (issue #67).
 *
 * The chain-of-sections orchestrator accumulates the leading verb of every
 * rewritten bullet (and the first word of the rewritten summary), then folds
 * the accumulated set into a soft-constraint sentence ("Verbs already used in
 * prior bullets: built, led, shipped. Choose different verbs where you can.")
 * that the orchestrator folds into the next section's SYSTEM prompt (a
 * reference-only block — not the user message — so small instruct models
 * don't echo it as content; see rewrite-resume.ts).
 *
 * Strictly lexical — we do NOT consult the eval rubric's action-verb list
 * (`eval/verbs.ts`) here. The constraint is "don't repeat the verb you
 * already used"; what matters is recurrence, not whether the first word is
 * a "good" verb by some external list. A bullet that opens with a weak verb
 * is still useful context — repeating it would compound the weakness.
