/**
 * Action-verb list used by the eval rubric's `actionVerbLead` criterion.
 *
 * Built as the scorer's curated past-tense set + a small eval-only
 * extension. The scorer set lives in `src/lib/score/score.ts` so when a
 * verb is added there it lights up here automatically — single source of
 * truth, no drift.
 *
 * The extension covers two cases the scorer set doesn't:
 *
 *   1. Tense breadth — small instruct models occasionally emit
 *      present-progressive forms ("Building / Driving / Owning") in
 *      rewrite output. The scorer never sees those because users write
 *      résumés in past tense.
 *   2. Cross-discipline verbs — "analyzed / authored / wrote / programmed"
 *      are normal for IC and writing-heavy roles. The scorer set leans
 *      eng/PM and would over-penalize a research-coded résumé.
 *
 * Weak generic verbs ("worked", "helped", "responsible", "assisted",
 * "participated") are deliberately absent — a bullet leading with one of
 * those SHOULD fail the criterion. That's the whole point.
