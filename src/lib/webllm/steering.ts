/**
 * Rewrite steering (issue #210) — the user's freeform intent + a page-length
 * target, folded into the rewrite system prompt as a SUFFIX appended after
 * the base guardrails.
 *
 * Why a suffix and not a template: the base prompts
 * (`SECTION_REWRITE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` / `SUMMARY_REWRITE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) carry the
 * number-preservation / no-fabrication guardrails. Interleaving user text into
 * those rules risks the small instruct model dropping a guardrail. Appending
 * the steering AFTER the rules keeps them intact and just layers intent on top
 * (see issue #210).
 *
 * Both halves are independent and optional:
 *   - `userInstructions` → appended verbatim ("The user has these additional
 *     instructions: …"). Empty/blank → contributes nothing.
 *   - `pageTarget` → a derived length-budget sentence PLUS explicit
 *     recency-weighted compression guidance (compress/combine OLDER experience
 *     entries preferentially, so the budget is spent on recent roles). Unset →
 *     contributes nothing.
 *
 * WebLLM is text-only and rewrites section-by-section, so it never sees PDF
 * pagination — `pageTarget` is therefore approximated as a per-page length
 * budget, NOT enforced as true pagination (issue #210 "Out of scope").

 *
 * Order: the length budget first (it constrains the shape), then the user's
