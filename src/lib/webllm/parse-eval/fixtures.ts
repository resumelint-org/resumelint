 * Inline eval fixtures for the parse-resume provider (issue #241).

 * PII POLICY (non-negotiable, public repo):
 *   - All personas are fully synthetic: fake names, @example.com emails.
 *   - Phone numbers MUST use a REAL area code + 555 exchange + 0100–0199
 *     subscriber (e.g. (312) 555-0123). Do NOT use 555 as the area code —
 *     555 is invalid NANP and fails libphonenumber-js isValid().
 *   - Employer names, school names, and locations are fictional.
 *   - These fixtures are inline text (not PDF binaries) but the policy
 *     still applies — the repo is public and text is indexable.
 *
 * NOTE: Do NOT use tests/fixtures/pdfs/*.expected.json for ground truth.
 * Those snapshots are lossy by design (keys/counts only, no field values)
 * and cannot score field accuracy. These inline valued fixtures are the
 * correct source.
