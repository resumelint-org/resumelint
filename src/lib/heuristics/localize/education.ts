 *
 * PURE: takes an already-parsed `CascadeResult`, never re-parses, never does
 * I/O. This is a refactor of the probe's inline logic, not a behavior
 * change — `probe-education.test.ts` must print byte-identical output after
 * switching to call this.
 *
 * The markdown header oracle lives in `./headers.ts` (shared with
 * `./skills.ts`). Read ITS header for why `HeaderOracle.unavailable` — a
 * scanned or sparse PDF with no markdown at all — is not the same fact as "no
 * education-like header was rejected", and why `education-no-section` refuses to
 * fire while it is true.
