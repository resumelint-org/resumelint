/**
 * Round-trip localization (issue #469 step 4) — extracted from
 * `corpus-roundtrip.test.ts` so a shared sweep (`/probe-resume`, a later
 * step) can reuse the SAME detector instead of a copy-pasted seventh
 * implementation. `/probe-roundtrip`'s harness IS the `RL_RT_PDF`-gated block
 * at the bottom of `corpus-roundtrip.test.ts` — there is no
 * `probe-roundtrip.test.ts` (issue #469's table is wrong on that row).
 *
 * PURE: every export here is a total function of two already-parsed
 * `CascadeResult`s (or their diffs). Nothing re-parses, renders, or does I/O —
 * the render→re-parse hop is the CALLER's job. `corpus-roundtrip.test.ts`
 * does that hop for both the corpus gate and the RL_RT_PDF harness, and
 * passes the resulting parses in here.
 *
 * This module is shared by TWO different consumers with different PII
 * postures over the SAME underlying comparison:
 *   - the corpus round-trip invariant gate (#293, top of
 *     `corpus-roundtrip.test.ts`) — fixtures only (synthetic personas), field
 *     MAPPING diffs (`entryListFails`) plus a values-included contact diff
 *     (`contactFails` — safe here because fixture PDFs carry no real PII).
 *   - the `RL_RT_PDF` dev harness (bottom of the same file) — an arbitrary,
 *     possibly PII-bearing résumé, values-included diffs throughout
 *     (`entryValueFails`, `skillsValueFails`, `harnessDiff`) so a maintainer
 *     can see exactly what corrupted. That output is scratch-only by the
 *     harness's own guardrail (gitignored `internal/roundtrip/`), never this
 *     module's concern.
 *
 * `localizeRoundtripHop` is the only export that produces `DefectClass[]` /
 * `DerivedSignals` — the PII-free half a future sweep consumes. It derives
 * strictly from BOOLEAN field-level comparisons, never from the value-diff
 * strings above (which may carry résumé text) — see `defect-classes.ts`'s
 * header for why that separation is load-bearing.
