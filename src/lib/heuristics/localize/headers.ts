/**
 * The shared markdown HEADER ORACLE — the one place `localize/skills.ts` and
 * `localize/education.ts` read `cascade.markdown` to ask:
 *
 *   > The strict section router (`matchSectionHeader`) is EXACT-match after a
 *   > trailing-punct strip. Did it REJECT a header that loosely reads as this
 *   > section (a leading decorative glyph #414, an out-of-alias wording, a
 *   > two-line wrap #374)?
 *
 * The two localizers had a ~60-line clone of this (headerCandidates →
 * missedHeaders → orphanBlock) plus a `looseXReason` that differed only in its
 * alias/anchor sets and one noun. One helper, two callers.
 *
 * ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ `unavailable` — why the oracle can FAIL TO RUN, and why that is not      │
 * │ the same as "no header was rejected". Read before touching this.         │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ `cascade.markdown` is `undefined` in two real, common cases              │
 * │ (`cascade.ts`): the layout probe called the PDF SCANNED (Tier 1 is        │
 * │ short-circuited entirely — there is no markdown to emit), or             │
 * │ `emitMarkdown()` returned undefined because the document was too sparse   │
 * │ for the positional emitter. In both, this oracle has NOTHING to read.     │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ The clone this replaced coalesced that to `""` — so "the oracle could     │
 * │ not run" became indistinguishable from "the oracle ran and found no       │
 * │ rejected header". That difference is load-bearing: `skills-header-        │
 * │ unrecognized` and `skills-no-section` are BYTE-IDENTICAL in               │
 * │ `ReproArtifact` (0 skills, no routed region), and the ONLY bit that       │
 * │ separates them is `skillsHeaderCandidateRejected` — which is derived      │
 * │ EXCLUSIVELY from this oracle. Coalescing therefore silently downgraded a  │
 * │ real header-rejection on a scanned/sparse PDF to `skills-no-section`,     │
 * │ which 9 corpus fixtures "cover" — so the sweep would answer COVERED       │
 * │ ("stop, we already reproduce this") for a defect NO fixture reproduces.   │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ So `unavailable` is reported, `derived.headerOracleUnavailable` carries   │
 * │ it, and the `*-no-section` classes REFUSE to fire while it is true. An    │
 * │ undecidable pair reports as undecided; it never guesses.                  │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * PURE: reads an already-parsed `CascadeResult`, never re-parses, never does I/O.
