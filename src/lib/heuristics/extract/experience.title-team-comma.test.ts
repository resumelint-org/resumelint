/**
 * Regression for #372 — a "Title, Team" role header over a
 * "Company | Location Dates" anchor line.
 *
 *   Software Engineer II, Business Credit Journey
 *   Globex Financial | New York, NY  August 2024 - Present
 *
 * The comma suffix "Business Credit Journey" is an internal TEAM, and the real
 * employer "Globex Financial" sits on the next (date-anchor) line. Neither reads
 * as a company by `looksLikeCompany` (no legal suffix), so disambiguation fell to
 * the title-keyword tiebreak, which blindly assigned the post-comma segment as
 * the company (`company = "Business Credit Journey"`) and demoted the real
 * employer to `team`. The fix routes the post-comma segment to `team` and takes
 * the company from the delimited anchor line's leading segment.
 *
 * Synthetic personas only, per the fixtures PII policy.
