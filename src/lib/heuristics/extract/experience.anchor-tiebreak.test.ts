/**
 * Regression tests for the anchor-position company/title tiebreak in
 * `disambiguateCompanyTitle` (#298 review).
 *
 * The tiebreak treats the date-anchor line as the COMPANY and the line above it
 * as the TITLE — but ONLY when the anchor line carries the reconstructed-export
 * signature: an edge/whitespace-bounded " · " middot marker (`anchorCarriesOrgSignal`).
 * Our own "Download PDF" emit always appends it to the company sub-line
 * ("Company · Location  Dates" or "Company · Dates"). Location- and title-keyword
 * signals were removed (Phase 4b): on a genuinely ambiguous two-line header the
 * anchor line's shape alone can't disambiguate company from title, so every
 * location/comma/keyword heuristic created a symmetric company↔title inversion on
 * generic real résumés. A genuine "Company (top) / Title + Dates (bottom)" résumé
 * whose anchor has no middot must NOT invert; it falls through to the pre-#298
 * default (company = first line) — exactly as it behaved before #298.
 *
 * Exercised through `extractExperience` (the real caller) rather than the
 * un-exported helper. Synthetic personas only, per the fixtures PII policy.
