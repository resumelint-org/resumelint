 *   - Bullet lines after the anchor, until the next anchor or section end,
 *     = the description.
 *
 * Fallback for a DATELESS section (#309): when the section carries no date
 * ranges at all, the `date_range` anchor finds nothing and yields zero blocks
 * (the "no date range ⇒ []" contract in `parseEntryBlocks`), collapsing the
 * whole section to zero roles. Re-run with the date-optional `"first_line"`
 * anchor so each `header + bullets` group becomes one dateless role.
 *
 * Confidence is per-entry, then averaged: we report the average of the
 * per-entry confidence as the section-level `experience` confidence.

 * propagation to the comma shape the issue scopes to.
 *
