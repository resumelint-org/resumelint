 * Experience-section dev probe — inert in CI, runs ONLY when
 * `RL_EXPERIENCE_PDF=<path>` is set:
 *
 *   RL_EXPERIENCE_PDF=/abs/path/to/resume.pdf npx vitest run \
 *     src/lib/heuristics/probe-experience.test.ts
 *
 * Extracts + VERIFIES the experience section of one arbitrary PDF so a real
 * (uncommitted, possibly PII-bearing) résumé can be triaged WITHOUT being
 * committed as a fixture. This is the execution vehicle for the
 * `probe-experience` skill — sibling of `probe-contact` / `probe-roundtrip`;
 * the pattern is: run the real parser via runCascade (the pdfjs worker only
 * resolves under the vitest transform — no standalone script), then show the
 * section extractor's INPUT (the experience region it scanned) next to its
 * OUTPUT (the parsed role entries) so a dropped/merged role is localizable.
 *
 * ── PII guardrail (same rules as probe-contact) ──
 * 1. The input PDF is local-only. NEVER commit it. `tests/fixtures/pdfs/` is
 *    synthetic-personas-only by policy.
 * 2. The console + JSON output prints role field VALUES (titles/companies/…)
 *    so the corruption is visible → scratch only. The full JSON goes to the
 *    gitignored `internal/` dir. Do not paste raw values into an
 *    issue/PR/Slack; cite the corruption by CATEGORY ("second role's header
 *    demoted to a bullet under the first role").
 *
 * ── The "verify" pass ──
 * There is no ground truth for a real résumé, so verification is a second,
 * independent scan with the date-range regex. Date ranges are the strongest
 * role-header signal, so the count of distinct date-range lines inside the
 * experience region is a lower-bound oracle for how many roles SHOULD have
 * segmented. The split localizes the failure:
 *   - entries == 0 AND region has date-range lines → PARSER bug (roles are in
 *     the region; entry segmentation dropped them)
 *   - entries  <  date-range lines                → UNDER-SEGMENTED (a role
 *     was likely merged into its neighbor — #341/#239 failure class)
 *   - entries >=  date-range lines                → ok (dateless roles can
 *     legitimately exceed the oracle)
