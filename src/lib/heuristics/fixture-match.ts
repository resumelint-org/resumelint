/**
 * The corpus-match engine (issue #469, step 3).
 *
 * Answers the one question the six read-only parser probes cannot:
 *
 *   > This real résumé exposes defect class C. **Does any fixture in
 *   > `tests/fixtures/pdfs/` already reproduce C?**
 *
 * `COVERED` means STOP: go fix the parser against the existing fixture and never
 * open the real résumé again. `NO FIXTURE COVERS THIS` is the only answer that
 * justifies minting a new synthetic fixture.
 *
 * Pure, lib-layer, NO I/O — same discipline as `repro-artifact.ts`. It reads only
 * `ReproArtifact` + `DerivedSignals`, both PII-free by construction (numbers,
 * booleans, fixed enums; no free-form `string` slot), so nothing this file
 * touches can carry a résumé value. See `defect-classes.ts`'s header.
 *
 * ── The four semantics that make this correct rather than merely plausible ──
 *
 * **1. Coverage is `exhibits()`, NOT artifact similarity.**
 * A fixture covers class C iff `defectSpec(C).exhibits(fixtureArtifact,
 * fixtureDerived)` is true. Full stop. It is NOT "the fixture's artifact looks
 * like the résumé's artifact". Those come apart constantly, and conflating them
 * is the failure mode that makes the whole tool worse than useless:
 *
 *   - Divergence on an axis OUTSIDE `spec.loadBearingAxes` (a different
 *     `pageCount`, an extra layout trigger, a shorter `experience` section) is
 *     INFORMATIONAL and must NEVER disqualify a cover. A one-page LaTeX fixture
 *     is a perfectly good reproducer for a defect a three-page Word résumé
 *     exposed, provided it exhibits the same class. Ranking a candidate by
 *     whole-artifact distance would silently reject it.
 *   - Conversely, near-identical artifacts do NOT imply coverage. See (2).
 *
 * Because `exhibits()` is a pure function of the load-bearing axes, this also
 * means: if a fixture's load-bearing axis VALUES all equal the résumé's, and the
 * résumé exhibits C, the fixture necessarily exhibits C too. That identity is
 * why `nearMisses` (below) is a meaningful "why not" and not a rationalization.
 *
 * **2. Structurally-identical fixtures are separated by `derived` alone.**
 * `skills-header-unrecognized` and `skills-no-section` are BYTE-IDENTICAL in
 * `ReproArtifact` (0 skills parsed, no routed `skills` section — a rejected
 * header leaves no structural trace). The same holds for the education pair, and
 * for ALL SIX round-trip classes, whose entire domain is "the value changed while
 * the structure did not". So the engine may never shortcut a comparison to "same
 * artifact ⇒ same defect": it must run `exhibits()` over BOTH inputs, every time.
 * `fixture-match.test.ts` pins exactly that with two fixtures whose
 * `ReproArtifact`s are deep-equal and whose verdicts differ.
 *
 * **3. `nearMisses` is the "why not", and only exists when there is no cover.**
 * Computed only for classes with `coveredBy.length === 0` — when a cover exists
 * the near-miss is noise, and the caller's next action ("go use that fixture") is
 * already decided. Candidates are every corpus fixture (none of which covers, by
 * construction), ranked by how few of the CLASS's load-bearing axes diverge from
 * the résumé. Non-load-bearing divergence is not counted and not reported: it
 * cannot be the reason the fixture fails to reproduce, so printing it would bury
 * the signal.
 *
 *   Ranking (total and deterministic — no `Math.random`, no `Date`, no locale):
 *     a. fewer diverged load-bearing axes first;
 *     b. ties broken by fixture path, ascending by UTF-16 code unit (`<`, not
 *        `localeCompare`, whose order is locale-dependent);
 *     c. remaining ties (duplicate paths) broken by corpus index, ascending.
 *   Corpus ARRIVAL order therefore cannot change the output — only its content.
 *
 *   An empty `divergedAxes` on a near-miss is a real signal, not a bug: it means
 *   the fixture matches the résumé on every load-bearing axis yet does not
 *   exhibit the class. Given (1), that can only be (a) the caller passed a class
 *   the RÉSUMÉ does not exhibit either, or (b) `exhibits()` reads an axis its
 *   spec forgot to declare load-bearing — a table bug. Both are worth surfacing;
 *   neither is worth silently hiding.
 *
 *   The list is capped at `NEAR_MISS_LIMIT`. The cap is VISIBLE, never a silent
 *   truncation: `nearMissCandidateCount` always reports how many candidates were
 *   ranked, so a printer can say "showing 3 of 41".
 *
 * **4. Array axes compare ORDER-INSENSITIVELY; absent ≡ zero for sections.**
 * `triggers` and `disagreements` are SETS in meaning — the parser happens to emit
 * them in a stable order today, but nothing in the type says so, and a reordering
 * refactor must not spuriously light up a diverged axis. So both are canonicalized
 * (each element to a stable string, then sorted) before comparison. Cardinality is
 * preserved (a sorted multiset, not a deduped set), so a doubled trigger still
 * reads as different. `sections.X` compares LINE COUNTS via `sectionLineCount`,
 * which returns 0 for a section the router never cut — deliberately conflating
 * "absent" with "present but empty", exactly as every probe's `region.length > 0`
 * test does.
