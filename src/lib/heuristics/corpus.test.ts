/**
 * Snapshot-driven corpus regression test (#1).
 *
 * Walks `tests/fixtures/pdfs/<category>/*.pdf`, runs `runCascade` +
 * `computeAnonymousAtsScore` against each file, and diffs the result against
 * a co-located `*.expected.json` snapshot.
 *
 * The snapshot shape is deliberately lossy: counts, field-presence flags, and
 * dimension numbers — never raw text or field values. That keeps the test
 * deterministic, fast to review in PRs, and free of PII so contributors can
 * inspect fixtures without leaking persona content.
 *
 * Workflow:
 *   - Add a PDF under `tests/fixtures/pdfs/<category>/<name>.pdf`.
 *   - `npm run bake-fixtures` (sets `UPDATE_FIXTURES=1`) writes
 *     `<name>.expected.json` next to it.
 *   - `npm run test` (no env) diffs subsequent runs against the snapshot.

 *  - v2 (#95): added `cascade.projectsCount`; Projects section is now
 *    extracted, so `fieldsPopulated` may include `projects`.
 *  - v3 (#96): added `cascade.achievementsCount`; the Achievements family
 *    (achievements/accomplishments/awards/activities) is promoted out of the
 *    `other` sink into a real extracted section, so `fieldsPopulated` may now
 *    include `heuristic_achievements`.
 *  - v4 (#425 follow-up): the parser now lifts a standalone header headline
 *    ("Engineering Lead") from the profile block via `extractHeadline`, so
 *    `fieldsPopulated` may include `headline` on résumés that carry one.
 *  - v5 (#469): added the `reproArtifact` block (`buildReproArtifact`, the
 *    structure-only parse fingerprint) and the `derived` block (the flat,
 *    boolean-only `DerivedSignals` — the value-level signals the artifact is
 *    structurally blind to, including the export → re-parse round-trip hop).
 *    Together they make each fixture a `CorpusEntry` the `/probe-resume` sweep
 *    (`fixture-match.ts`) can match a real résumé's defects against WITHOUT
 *    re-parsing 45 PDFs. Both blocks are PII-free BY TYPE — numbers, booleans,
 *    fixed enums, no free-form string slot — so the snapshots stay "lossy by
