 * empty-result.ts — the from-scratch résumé factory (#313).
 *
 * `buildBlankResult()` seeds a `CascadeResult` with no parsed content and NO
 * triggers, so it renders through `ReconstructedResume` as a normal, fully
 * editable resume rather than tripping any of the parser-audit degenerate
 * branches (`fonts_unmappable` in `Result`, the scanned-abandon path).
 * Mirrors the empty branch of `buildScannedResult` (cascade.ts) but is
 * AUTHORED, not parsed — hence `suggestedEscalation: "none"` and `tiers: []`.
 *
 * `tiers: []` doubles as a structural signal elsewhere in the app (see
 * `useDownloadPdf.ts`'s download-source tagging) that a result was authored
 * from scratch rather than produced by any parse path — every real cascade
 * path (PDF or DOCX) always pushes at least `"t0_layout"` / `"t1_openresume"`
 * onto `tiers`.
