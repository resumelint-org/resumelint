/**
 * Disagreement detector — heuristic vs LLM parse (issue #242, headline feature).
 *
 * The deterministic heuristic parser is what a *generic* ATS text extractor
 * sees: drop columns, lose roles, miss contact fields. The opt-in WebLLM pass
 * recovers what is actually on the page. Diffing the two surfaces the GAP — the
 * exact thing a dumb extractor would silently miss — and, by correlating each
 * gap with the layout trigger that caused it, names the *cause*:
 *
 *   "An ATS likely drops 2 of your 4 roles — your two-column layout
 *    interleaves them."
 *
 * This module is PURE and lib-layer: it takes two parsed shapes plus the active
 * layout triggers and returns a flat `ParseDisagreement[]`. No engine, no React,
 * no I/O — every branch is unit-testable without WebGPU.
 *
 * ── Disagreement model ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A disagreement is always framed as "the LLM recovered something the heuristic
 * (the dumb extractor) did NOT." The reverse direction (heuristic richer than
 * the LLM) is not a gap an ATS would miss, so it is never reported.
 *
 * Four kinds, each fired by a distinct, non-overlapping condition:
 *
 *   - `missing_field`   — a scalar contact/summary field is empty on the
 *                         heuristic side but present on the LLM side.
 *   - `dropped_section` — a whole section (experience / education / skills) is
 *                         empty on the heuristic side but non-empty on the LLM
 *                         side. The *entire* section vanished.
 *   - `dropped_role`    — the heuristic recovered SOME experience entries but
 *                         FEWER than the LLM, and no two-column interleave is
 *                         implicated. Roles were lost, not glued together.
 *   - `merged_roles`    — same partial-experience count gap as `dropped_role`,
 *                         but a `two_column` trigger is active: the classic
 *                         cause is two columns being read across, gluing
 *                         adjacent roles into one entry. Distinguishing this
 *                         from `dropped_role` lets the copy name the mechanism.
 *
 * The experience partition is total and exclusive:
 *   heuristic 0,  llm ≥ 1            → dropped_section
 *   heuristic ≥ 1, llm > heuristic   → merged_roles (if two_column) | dropped_role
 *   llm ≤ heuristic                  → no experience disagreement
 *
 * Education and skills report only the whole-section case (`dropped_section`):
 * neither has a dedicated partial-gap kind in the AC, and manufacturing one
 * from differently-shaped entry objects would be fragile. A partial education
 * gap is intentionally not reported (see the module test for the rationale).

// ── Whole-section drop credibility ───────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * A `dropped_section` is only credible when the section genuinely exists on the
 * page. The heuristic sectioner is the ground truth on section *headers*: it
 * detects a "Skills"/"Experience"/"Education" heading independent of whether the
 * field extractor downstream recovered any entries. So a whole-section drop is
 * honest only when:
 *
 *   - the sectioner found the header (`presentSections.has(name)`) — the section
 *     is on the page but the extractor produced nothing, a real extraction
 *     failure; OR
 *   - a page-wide layout trigger is active (`scanned` / `two_column` /
 *     `fonts_unmappable`) that plausibly ate the header along with the section.
 *
 * Absent both, the text layer extracted cleanly and no such header exists — an
 * LLM that nonetheless returns entries for the section *synthesized* them from
 * other prose (technologies named in experience bullets, the summary, etc.).
 * That is not a section an ATS dropped, so it must not be reported. This is the
 * deterministic backstop the parser prompt alone cannot enforce against a small
 * in-browser model.

 *
 * Both sides are {@link CanonicalResume} shapes (#445): `heuristic` is the real
 * cascade canonical; `llm` is the on-device parse coerced through
 * `projectLlmDiff`. The whole-section-drop gate is derived from the *heuristic*
 * canonical's section headers (`heuristic.sections.byName` keys — the sectioner
 * is the ground truth on headers), so an LLM that synthesizes a section absent
