 * Repro artifact builder — a structure-only, PII-redacted-BY-CONSTRUCTION
 * snapshot of a parse, for the "Report a parsing gap" loop (issue #245).
 *
 * ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ WHY THIS FILE NEVER CARRIES RÉSUMÉ TEXT — read before editing.            │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ offlinecv is a PUBLIC repo. A user reporting a parser gap is, by         │
 * │ definition, sitting on top of their OWN résumé — real name, real email,   │
 * │ real phone, real bullet text. If any of that literal text rode along in   │
 * │ the downloadable repro artifact, the user would unknowingly publish their │
 * │ PII the moment they attach the file to a public GitHub issue. The         │
 * │ committed PDF binary is already the hard exposure surface (see CLAUDE.md   │
 * │ "Test fixtures — PII policy"); a text artifact would be a SECOND, softer   │
 * │ one that looks innocuous.                                                  │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ So the artifact captures ONLY the *shape* of the parse — layout triggers, │
 * │ section boundaries (names + line counts), parse cardinality, and          │
 * │ disagreement KINDS — never a single literal field value. This mirrors the │
 * │ `*.expected.json` corpus snapshots, which are lossy by design             │
 * │ (keys/counts/structure, never values) and therefore PII-free             │
 * │ automatically.                                                            │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ PII-redacted BY CONSTRUCTION, not by filtering:                           │
 * │   1. The exported `ReproArtifact` type admits ONLY numbers, booleans, and │
 * │      values drawn from fixed enums (LayoutTrigger, section names,         │
 * │      disagreement kinds, the splitter source). There is no free-form      │
 * │      `string` slot a literal résumé value could occupy.                   │
 * │   2. The builder reads counts/enums/booleans off the inputs and NEVER     │
 * │      reads `rawText`, `markdown`, link URLs, parsed scalar VALUES, the    │
 * │      section line text, or `ParseDisagreement.heuristicValue` / `llmValue`│
 * │      (which MAY hold literal text). Those properties are simply untouched. │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ DO NOT "helpfully" add raw-text capture here (a sample line, the failing  │
 * │ bullet, the recovered email, a link URL, …). Adding it would force you to │
 * │ widen `ReproArtifact` with a free `string` field — which breaks the       │
 * │ load-bearing `repro-artifact.test.ts` PII assertion AND defeats this      │
 * │ comment. If a maintainer needs the literal text to build a fixture, they  │
 * │ re-export the template with a SYNTHETIC persona (CLAUDE.md); they do not  │
 * │ harvest it from a user's report.                                          │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ Likewise: this builder feeds a LOCAL download only. There is no upload    │
 * │ path, silent or otherwise. Any future ingestion is a separate,           │
 * │ explicitly-consented decision and out of scope here (issue #245).         │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Pure and lib-layer: no React, no I/O. The component serializes the returned
 * object to JSON and hands it to the browser's download path.
