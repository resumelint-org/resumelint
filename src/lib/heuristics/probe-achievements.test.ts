/**
 * Achievements-section dev probe — inert in CI, runs ONLY when
 * `RL_ACHIEVEMENTS_PDF=<path>` is set:
 *
 *   RL_ACHIEVEMENTS_PDF=/abs/path/to/resume.pdf npx vitest run \
 *     src/lib/heuristics/probe-achievements.test.ts
 *
 * Extracts + VERIFIES the achievements section of one arbitrary PDF so a real
 * (uncommitted, possibly PII-bearing) résumé can be triaged WITHOUT being
 * committed as a fixture. This is the execution vehicle for the
 * `probe-achievements` skill — sibling of `probe-experience` / `probe-contact` /
 * `probe-roundtrip`; the pattern is identical: run the real parser via
 * runCascade (the pdfjs worker only resolves under the vitest transform — no
 * standalone script), then show the section extractor's INPUT (the achievements
 * region it scanned) next to its OUTPUT (the parsed achievement entries) so a
 * dropped/merged/mis-split achievement is localizable.
 *
 * ── PII guardrail (same rules as the sibling probes) ──
 * 1. The input PDF is local-only. NEVER commit it. `tests/fixtures/pdfs/` is
 *    synthetic-personas-only by policy.
 * 2. The console + JSON output prints achievement VALUES (titles, years) so the
 *    corruption is visible → scratch only. The full JSON goes to the gitignored
 *    `internal/` dir. Do not paste raw values into an issue/PR/Slack; cite the
 *    defect by CATEGORY ("the type label was split at the wrong middot").
 *
 * ── type / description ──
 * The parser stores the type label in its own `type` field, lifted off the
 * header's leading " · " run once at parse (#456); `title` carries only the
 * description. That stored `type` is the run the reconstructed view and the
 * Download PDF render bold (#452), and the field the inline editor commits
 * against (#454). The probe prints both halves as stored — no re-split — so a
 * mis-emphasized header ("the whole prose title bolded", "the type swallowed the
 * description") is visible as a parse defect, not just a styling one.
 *
 * ── The "verify" pass ──
 * There is no ground truth for a real résumé, so verification is a second,
 * independent scan of the region: every line that is NOT bullet-marked is a
 * candidate achievement HEADER, so the count of such lines is a lower-bound
 * oracle for how many entries SHOULD have segmented. The split localizes the
 * failure:
 *   - entries == 0 AND the region is non-empty  → PARSER-MISS (the block is in
 *     the region; entry segmentation dropped it)
 *   - entries  <  header-shaped lines           → UNDER-SEGMENTED (achievements
 *     merged into a neighbor entry)
 *   - entries >=  header-shaped lines           → ok (a wrapped header can
 *     legitimately exceed the oracle)
