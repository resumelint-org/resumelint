 * Corpus round-trip invariant gate (#293).
 *
 * For every fixture PDF, assert that our own reconstructed-PDF output re-parses
 * back to the same structured résumé:
 *
 *   parse1 = runCascade(fixture)
 *   model  = buildAtsResumeModel(parse1, score(parse1))
 *   bytes  = renderAtsResumePdf(model)          // the "Download PDF" surface
 *   parse3 = runCascade(bytes)
 *   assert invariants(parse1, parse3)
 *
 * This is a SELF-CONSISTENCY check — the renderer must emit shapes our own
 * parser round-trips — fully in our control on both ends, no dependency on
 * quirky source PDFs. It generalizes the single-fixture `render-roundtrip.repro`
 * test (#284/#291/#292) to the whole corpus so future renderer or parser
 * changes can't silently regress a round-trip that works today.
 *
 * Only the parse1-vs-parse3 diff carries signal. The original 5-step idea also
 * diffed rendered PDF bytes against a re-render; `renderAtsResumePdf` is
 * deterministic, so those bytes are identical and prove only render determinism,
 * never parse quality. That step is intentionally omitted (#293 scope note).
 *
 * `triggers` are deliberately NOT an invariant: reconstruction normalizes layout
 * to a single-column ATS-clean shape on purpose, so layout triggers (two_column,
 * etc.) legitimately drop on re-parse. Asserting trigger equality would flag the
 * intended normalization as a regression.
 *
 * PII-free: this asserts field mapping (counts, degree/title/company strings that
 * are synthetic-persona by policy), never dumps a snapshot of values.
 *
 * ── Known-failure baseline (ratchet) ──
 * The round-trip is NOT yet clean across the whole corpus — the audit that
 * motivated this gate surfaced a batch of latent renderer/parser bugs (education
 * count inflation, experience header re-segmentation in dense/two-column layouts,
 * skills token splits, one total re-parse collapse). Those are tracked as
 * follow-up issues, not fixed here. `KNOWN_FAILURES` lists, per fixture, which
 * invariant CATEGORIES are currently allowed to fail. The gate therefore:
 *   - fails if a NON-baselined category regresses on any fixture (the ratchet's
 *     teeth — protects every invariant that passes today), and
 *   - fails if a BASELINED category now PASSES (stale entry — a bug got fixed,
 *     so its baseline line must be deleted, tightening the gate).
 * Net effect: the baseline can only shrink. Fix a bug → delete its line.

  // The experience header title/company SWAP (#298) — title and company traded
  // places on re-parse in denser / multi-role / two-column layouts — is FIXED:
  // `disambiguateCompanyTitle` now uses the date-anchor line position as a
  // tiebreak (anchor line = company, line above = title) when text-content
  // heuristics can't decide, so the reconstructed stacked shape re-segments to
  // the same title/company it was built from. Fixtures cleared by that fix have
  // had their `experience` line removed here (the ratchet forces it).
  //
  // The `experience` entries that REMAIN below are NOT the swap — they are
  // distinct, separately-rooted round-trip bugs that the swap fix does not (and
  // should not) touch; each warrants its own follow-up:
  //
  //   - classic / weasyprint (#326, wontfix by-design): the ONLY diff is a
  //     Unicode glyph the #295 `toWinAnsi` sanitizer rewrites lossily — a role
  //     title "… Intern → Junior Engineer" round-trips as "… Intern -> Junior
  //     Engineer" (→ U+2192 → "->"). A #295 render-sanitizer artifact, not the
  //     header swap. Accepted tradeoff (no-crash > glyph fidelity); a real fix
  //     needs a Unicode-capable embedded font. See #326 for the decision record.

  //   - deedy macfonts/openfonts: experience now round-trips (all 6 roles, same
  //     company/title P1↔P3) after the Phase 4b middot-only anchor gate — the old
  //     location/keyword org-signal disjuncts were inverting a reconstructed role
  //     differently from the first parse, breaking fidelity; dropping them fixed
  //     it. The skills-line token split (#299/#E) is ALSO fixed now (#301 —
  //     `wrap()` keeps each " · "-delimited skill atomic instead of breaking mid-
  //     word), so these fixtures round-trip clean; no line remains here.

  //   - openresume-react-pdf: a dateless role whose title carries an inline year
  //     ("Software Engineer Intern Summer 2022") round-trips with the year split
  //     out as `start_date` ("… Summer" + 2022) — an inline-year-in-title
  //     asymmetry, not the swap. (The #299/#E skills split is fixed by #301.)
  "unknown/openresume-react-pdf.pdf": ["experience"],

  //   - awesome-cv-cv: the #341 isProseLine fix RECOVERS a real role this CV was
  //     dropping (an "Undergraduate Research, … Lab(Prof. …)" header the old
  //     "Company. City" prose false-positive had swallowed). Net +1 real role
  //     (16 → 17). That recovered role's header packed inline abbreviated dates
  //     with an "Expected" marker ("Researcher … Mar. 2016 Exp. Jun. 2017").
  //     #383 taught DATE_RANGE_RE to absorb the optional "Expected"/"Exp." end-
  //     date qualifier, so the role now splits its title from a clean
  //     "Mar. 2016 – Jun. 2017" range and the experience round-trips; baseline
  //     removed.

  // Experience SWAP cleared by #298 (removed from these lines). The skills-line
  // token split (#299/#E) is fixed by #301, so google-docs-skia-proxy-role-first-
  // experience and -programs-skills-software round-trip clean; no line remains
  // for either. (For programs-skills-software the education "institution
  // pollution" was already fixed in #294 — "University of California" → "… ·
  // Berkeley, CA" glued — via the " · " middot boundary; education round-trips.)

  // Total re-parse collapse (#296) — FIXED: the reconstructed PDF read back
  // empty because the compact single-role + single-degree résumé rendered as
  // only ~11 line-granular text items, tripping the `avgItems < 15` arm of the
  // scanned probe despite 439 real characters. That arm short-circuited the
  // whole cascade (contact, experience, and education all dropped). Removing the
  // spurious item-count arm from `probeScanned` (character sparsity is the
  // reliable scanned signal) restores the full round-trip; no line remains.

  // ── One-line experience header (#436) ──
  // The Download-PDF exporter emits a ONE-LINE experience header
  // ("Title · Company, Location · Team", date flush-right) instead of the older
  // stacked two-line shape (#284/#298). The text-only parser has no font signal,
  // so it used the two-line STRUCTURE to tell title from company; on one line
  // that signal is gone. #436 has TWO roots:
  //
  //   1. SWAP — a neutral two-segment middot header ("Composer · Northwind
  //      Ensemble", no company-suffix / title-keyword either side) re-parsed
  //      title↔company-swapped because the no-signal default read the first
  //      segment as the company. FIXED: the `middot` title-first default in
  //      `mapWithoutCompanyMatch` reads "Title · Company" per the export/#217
  //      convention. Seven fixtures cleared their baseline via the ratchet.
  //   2. TRUNCATION — a PARENTHETICAL / multi-word company on the one-line shape
  //      ("Danggeun Pay Inc. (KarrotPay)" → "(KarrotPay)") still re-parses
  //      truncated. STILL OPEN — the remaining lines below are this root (plus
  //      two-column re-segmentation), a distinct follow-up from the swap.
  //
  // Delete each line below as its root lands (the ratchet forces it — a fixed
  // fixture trips the stale-entry check).

 *     src/lib/heuristics/corpus-roundtrip.test.ts
 *
 * Round-trip-audits one arbitrary PDF, so a real (uncommitted, possibly
 * PII-bearing) résumé can be triaged WITHOUT being committed as a fixture. This
 * is how the education (#291) and summary (#292) regressions were originally
 * localized. Kept out of the corpus gate above precisely because the input may
 * carry PII.
 *
 * `RL_RT_ROUNDS` (default 1) is the number of render→re-parse HOPS:
 *   - 1 hop  = parse1 → render → parse2                    (2 parses)
 *   - 2 hops = parse1 → render → parse2 → render → parse3  (3 parses)
 * A second hop surfaces corruption that only compounds once a reconstructed PDF
 * is itself re-reconstructed (the parse→export→parse→export→parse cycle).
 *
 * Unlike the corpus gate above (which asserts field MAPPING, never dumping
 * values), this harness prints per-hop field-level VALUE diffs (before → after)
 * so the exact corruption is visible — that output carries PII by design.
 *
 * The full JSON report is written to a gitignored scratch dir (`internal/` is
 * gitignored; default `internal/roundtrip/`, override with `RL_RT_OUT=<dir>`).
 * ⚠️ Both the input PDF and this JSON carry PII — NEVER commit either.
