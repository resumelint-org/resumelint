/**
 * Corpus round-trip invariant gate (#293).
 *
 * For every fixture PDF, assert that our own reconstructed-PDF output re-parses
 * back to the same structured résumé:
 *
 *   parse1 = runCascade(fixture)
 *   model  = buildAtsResumeModel(parse1, score(parse1))
 *   bytes  = renderAtsResumePdf(model)          // the "Download PDF" surface
 *   parse3 = runCascade(bytes)
 *   assert invariants(parse1, parse3)
 *
 * This is a SELF-CONSISTENCY check — the renderer must emit shapes our own
 * parser round-trips — fully in our control on both ends, no dependency on
 * quirky source PDFs. It generalizes the single-fixture `render-roundtrip.repro`
 * test (#284/#291/#292) to the whole corpus so future renderer or parser
 * changes can't silently regress a round-trip that works today.
 *
 * Only the parse1-vs-parse3 diff carries signal. The original 5-step idea also
 * diffed rendered PDF bytes against a re-render; `renderAtsResumePdf` is
 * deterministic, so those bytes are identical and prove only render determinism,
 * never parse quality. That step is intentionally omitted (#293 scope note).
 *
 * `triggers` are deliberately NOT an invariant: reconstruction normalizes layout
 * to a single-column ATS-clean shape on purpose, so layout triggers (two_column,
 * etc.) legitimately drop on re-parse. Asserting trigger equality would flag the
 * intended normalization as a regression.
 *
 * PII-free: this asserts field mapping (counts, degree/title/company strings that
 * are synthetic-persona by policy), never dumps a snapshot of values.
 *
 * ── Known-failure baseline (ratchet) ──
 * The round-trip is NOT yet clean across the whole corpus — the audit that
 * motivated this gate surfaced a batch of latent renderer/parser bugs (education
 * count inflation, experience header re-segmentation in dense/two-column layouts,
 * skills token splits, one total re-parse collapse). Those are tracked as
 * follow-up issues, not fixed here. `KNOWN_FAILURES` lists, per fixture, which
 * invariant CATEGORIES are currently allowed to fail. The gate therefore:
 *   - fails if a NON-baselined category regresses on any fixture (the ratchet's
 *     teeth — protects every invariant that passes today), and
 *   - fails if a BASELINED category now PASSES (stale entry — a bug got fixed,
 *     so its baseline line must be deleted, tightening the gate).
 * Net effect: the baseline can only shrink. Fix a bug → delete its line.
