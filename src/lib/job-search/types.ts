/**
 * Provider adapter contract for the in-app job search (#319, slice 2 of the
 * job-search epic).
 *
 * A `JobProvider` fetches postings from one keyless, CORS-open job feed and
 * maps its response shape into the normalized `JobPosting` below. The fan-out
 * orchestrator (`search.ts`) runs every enabled provider through
 * `Promise.allSettled`, so one provider failing (network, CORS, malformed
 * JSON) never rejects the whole search — its results are simply absent and the
 * UI notes the degraded source.
 *
 * The keyed BYOK adapter (#320) implements this same interface and joins the
 * registry only when a key is present — nothing about this contract changes for
 * that slice.
