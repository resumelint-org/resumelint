 * Resume ↔ JD coverage check.
 *
 * Inputs: the cascade's `parsed` shape plus the extracted JD terms.
 * Output: which terms are covered, which are missing, plus a weighted score.
 *
 * Coverage rules:
 *   - Build a flat lowercased corpus from the resume — summary, skills array,
 *     experience titles + descriptions, education degree + institution +
 *     description.
 *   - For each JD term:
 *       · `skill` source: check any alias of that canonical ID against the
 *         corpus, word-boundary-aware via the same regex shape as the JD
 *         extractor.
 *       · `noun` source: check the literal phrase (lowercased) against the
 *         corpus, word-boundary-aware.
 *   - Weight: skill = 1.0, noun = 0.5. Score is weighted coverage as a
 *     percentage: `sum(coveredWeights) / sum(totalWeights) * 100`.
 *
 * The score is intentionally a single number — the UI does not show it as
 * "X% match" (see CONTRIBUTING.md / copy discipline). The copy is built
 * around the covered/missing counts; the score is the supporting headline.
