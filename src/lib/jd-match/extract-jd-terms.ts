/**
 * Deterministic JD term extraction.
 *
 * Two passes:
 *   1. Skill-phrase pass — phrase-match every alias in the curated dictionary
 *      against the JD body, dedupe to canonical IDs.
 *   2. Noun-phrase pass — heuristic regex over the remaining text to pick up
 *      capitalized multi-word phrases and ≥2-letter acronyms not in the
 *      dictionary. Weighted lower at the coverage step.
 *
 * Both passes ignore boilerplate sections (EEO, benefits, legal disclaimers).
 * The anchor list below is the full set of phrases we use to detect those
 * sections — match an anchor anywhere on a line and we skip that line plus
 * everything up to a blank line or another anchor.
 *
 * For each extracted term we record a short snippet (~80 chars) showing
 * where in the JD it surfaced. The UI hovers that snippet so a user can
 * see *why* a term was extracted.
 */

/**
 * Anchor phrases (lowercased, normalized whitespace) that mark the start of
 * boilerplate JD sections we want to exclude from term extraction.
 *
 * Sources for the list:
 *   - EEO / OFCCP "equal opportunity" disclaimers shipped in nearly every
 *     US tech JD.
 *   - Benefits / perks blocks ("we offer", "what we offer", "perks").
 *   - Visa / sponsorship / pay-range legalese.
 *   - "About us" boilerplate is intentionally NOT excluded — it often
 *     contains domain skills ("we're a Rust-first infra company") that v1
 *     should pick up.
 *
 * If you add an anchor, lowercase it and keep it phrase-shaped — we match
 * with `.includes()` after whitespace normalization, not regex.
