/**
 * run-llm-match.ts — semantic JD-match orchestrator + path selection (#202).
 *
 * Chains the two LLM calls behind the stable `JdMatchResult` API:
 * `loadEngine` → `extractRequirements` (#200) → `judgeEvidence` (#201) →
 * `{ path: "semantic", verdicts, summary }`.
 *
 * Fallback discipline: ANY failure resolves to the deterministic keyword path
 * (`{ path: "keyword" }`) — never a rejection, never a blank panel. That covers
 * an engine load error (which is also how a missing-WebGPU environment
 * manifests if the caller's `detectWebGpu` gate was stale), a requirement-
 * extraction hard failure (`RequirementExtractionError`), and any unexpected
 * inference error. A valid-but-EMPTY extraction also degrades: it is not a
 * failure per #200's contract, but zero verdicts would render an empty
 * semantic panel, and the keyword path always has something to show.
 * `judgeEvidence` never throws by contract — its failure mode is per-batch
 * `missing` verdicts, which stay on the semantic path by design.
 *
 * Caller contract: the `detectWebGpu` gate and the ConsentDialog gate for
 * restricted models run BEFORE this is called — this module never prompts.
 * `modelId` is the `useModelSelection` selected id; it is threaded both to
 * `loadEngine` and to `judgeEvidence`'s inference guard. `onProgress` receives
 * the engine download/load progress (first call on a cold cache is a large
 * weight fetch).
 *
 * Chunk discipline: this module transitively imports `web-llm.ts` (via
 * `judge-evidence.ts`), so it is NOT exported from the `jd-match` barrel
 * (`index.ts`), which the JD-fit entry imports statically. Consumers
 * dynamic-import this module (the cascade-tier pattern) so WebLLM stays out
 * of the entry chunk until the user opts into the semantic match.
