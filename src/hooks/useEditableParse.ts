 * useEditableParse — in-memory overrides for the reconstructed resume fields.
 *
 * Scope (issue #58): contact fields (name, email, phone, linkedin, location)
 * and experience role headers (title, company, start_date, end_date).
 * Issue #82 adds bullet-text overrides (keyed by BulletObservation.index) and
 * a `resetAll`, and the overrides are now authoritative — App folds them back
 * into the parse via applyOverrides and re-grades the score + JD coverage.
 * Issue #176 adds education field overrides (keyed by education index, mirroring
 * experienceOverrides) and a skills override (add/remove against parsed.skills),
 * folded by the same applyOverrides path so a corrected degree or an
 * added/removed skill re-grades Completeness + JD coverage AND flows into the
 * downloaded PDF (App passes the edited parse to both the scorer and the export).
 * Overrides are held in component state and lost on reset — no persistence
 * is expected or provided.
 *
 * The hook owns its own useState so feature components stay free of raw
 * state boilerplate (CLAUDE.md §Data & Hooks).

// EXTRA link — appended, and back-filling an empty linkedin/github slot only
// when that slot is empty, matching the old `addedProfiles` behavior. The UI
// decides which by affordance: editing a detected legacy link row tags the
// override with its `legacyKey`; the "+ Add link" affordance mints an untagged
// extra. `applyOverrides` folds the whole list back into the legacy slots +
// `parsed.profiles[]`, so every downstream reader (scorer, ContactCard, JSON
// export) sees one consistent list.
